# Simple Traits in Java

## Proof of Concept

This project aimed at implementing Traits in Java using javassist

##Purpose

This was a project for the [AP](https://fenix.ist.utl.pt/disciplinas/pava3/2010-2011/2-semestre?locale=en_EN) course at [IST](http://www.ist.utl.pt/en); it should be seen as a mere academic effort to implement a method of injecting code at runtime using AOP.
